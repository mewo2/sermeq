## Sermeq: Python utility functions for glaciology

This is a library of standard glaciological values and functions, for those
doing glaciology in Python. At present, the selection is somewhat biased
towards whatever I've been working on recently, but pull requests are very
welcome.

The name "sermeq" comes from the Greenlandic word for "glacier".
